Thank you for providing the detailed summary of our conversation. I now have a clear understanding of the work we've done so far on both the backend (.NET) and frontend (React) sides of your EduSync project.

Based on the summary, I see several areas where I could continue to help:

1. Fix import errors in React components
2. Create missing components (ErrorAlert, LoadingSpinner, CourseCard)
3. Set up Redux store and slices
4. Configure Vite build process
5. Resolve backend warnings
6. Help with database migrations and Azure SQL configuration

Could you please let me know which specific task you'd like to focus on next? Also, it would be helpful if you could share the relevant code files you're currently working with so I can provide more targeted assistance.
